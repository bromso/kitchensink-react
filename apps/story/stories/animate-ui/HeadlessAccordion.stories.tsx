        <AccordionButton>What is Headless UI?</AccordionButton>
        <AccordionPanel>
          Headless UI provides completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to
          integrate with Tailwind CSS.
        </AccordionPanel>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem>
        <AccordionButton>How does it differ from Base?</AccordionButton>
        <AccordionPanel>
          The headless variant uses Headless UI primitives (Disclosure) instead of Base UI, offering
          a different API with render props for maximum flexibility.
        </AccordionPanel>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem>
        <AccordionButton>Is it animated?</AccordionButton>
        <AccordionPanel>
          Yes. Animate UI wraps the headless primitives with smooth motion transitions for open and
          close states.
